Great job! Your alghhoritm is  a correct implementation of simulated anneling for the setcover problem.

Here are some suggestion for further improving:
You can use a different fuction to check if a solution is valid or not . Iterating over each taken element of the solution and stopping early if you see that all sets are covered, you can slash executions time this way.
(Although that doesn't improve number of calls to fitness fuction or lower the minimum cost found , It's useful to do faster test in future).
Looking at your graphs, it looks like that for small universe sizes your fuction get rapidly to a plateaux , for big ones it never gets there (as you also correctly observed in the README) . A way to change that is by
changing maximum number of steps(max_iter) using the universe size information (bigger universe, more steps and smaller universe, less steps)  and dropping the early exit for low temperature. 
Only decreasing the min_temp stop condition in the last three cases( as you suggested in the readme) won't work because you'll get anyway to the maximum number of steps(max_iter=20_000) .
